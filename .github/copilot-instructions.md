1. Always tell me what changes you are going to make before making them, show me the code modifications that you plan to make, and then ask my permission before proceeding.  If I respond "yes" to the next prompt, then you can proceed with the changes.  If I respond "no", then please stop responding.
2. When making code changes, never remove code that is commented out.
