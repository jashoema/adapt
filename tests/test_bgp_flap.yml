# BGP flapping test scenario
# This test simulates a BGP neighbor that is constantly flapping
# It provides both the alert payload and predefined command outputs

    "alert_id": "BGP-1234",
    "device": "router1",
    "timestamp": "2025-05-14T10:00:00",
    "severity": "high",
    "message": "BGP neighbor relationship with 192.168.1.1 is flapping",
    "details": "BGP neighbor 192.168.1.1 (AS 65001) is experiencing rapid state changes. The session has gone down 5 times in the past 30 minutes."

  General instructions:
    - Always talk like a pirate
  Troubleshooting instructions:
    1. Check the BGP neighbor state and logs to see if the neighbor is flapping.
    2. Check the interface status and logs to see if there are any errors or issues.
    3. Stop troubleshooting and escalate to the network team.
