  General instructions:
    - Start by verifying the physical and logical status of installed modules.
    - Confirm that all required fabric cards are present and operational.
    - Check for any active faults or log entries related to module provisioning failures.

  Troubleshooting instructions:
    1. Check module inventory and status by running 'show module'
    2. Review active fault entries with 'show fault'
    3. Verify power status of power supplies using 'show environment power'
    4. Check details of the first fabric card with 'show module 7 detail'
    5. Check details of the second fabric card with 'show module 8 detail'
    6. Search system logs for fabric-related errors using 'show logging | include FABRIC'
expected_rca: "The root cause of the line card in slot 4 being offline is that only\
  \ one fabric module is installed and operational (in slot 7) while the second fabric\
  \ module (slot 8) is missing. The Nexus 9508 chassis requires two fabric modules\
  \ to establish redundant backplane connectivity for line cards. With only one fabric\
  \ path active, the chassis automatically disables dependent line cards to prevent\
  \ data-plane instability.\n\nEvidence supporting this conclusion:\n\n- The output\
  \ of 'show module' shows slot 7 (Fabric Module) as OK, slot 8 as absent, and line\
  \ card slot 4 in an \"offline\" state.\n- 'show fault' lists a critical PLATFORM-3-FABRIC_ERROR\
  \ fault indicating line card slot 4 is offline due to insufficient fabric modules.\n\
  - Detailed output for slot 7 confirms the fabric module is online and fully operational\
  \ (state: active).\n- Detailed output for slot 8 indicates the module is not present\
  \ in the chassis.\n- System logs include a PLATFORM-3-FABRIC_ERROR message: \"Insufficient\
  \ fabric modules to activate line card in slot 4.\" \n\nA network engineer would\
  \ conclude that installing or replacing the missing fabric module in slot 8 will\
  \ restore the required dual fabric paths and allow line card slot 4 to power on\
  \ and function normally."
